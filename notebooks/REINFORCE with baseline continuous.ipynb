    "# REINFORCE with baseline for continuous action space\n",

    "This is an implementation of REINFORCE with baseline with modifications to deal with bounded continuous action spaces. See Sutton & Barto, Section 13.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following changes to the previous notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate network for policy and value function\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Adjust policy network to output means and standard deviations of a normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use of truncated normal distribution for bounded action space\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use of parameters given in the PPO paper, don't do hyper-parameter search anymore\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set up training and evaluation on the Mujoco environments used in the PPO paper, to be used as a comparison for our PPO implementation"
